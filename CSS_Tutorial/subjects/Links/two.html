            <li>JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in just 10 days in May 1995, while he was working at Netscape
                Communications
                Corporation.</li>
            <li>Contrary to popular belief, JavaScript has nothing to do with Java. The name was chosen by Netscape to
                capitalize on the
                popularity of Java at the time.</li>
            <li>JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one task at a time. However, it does support
                asynchronous
                programming techniques such as callbacks and promises.</li>
            <li>The world's largest community-driven JavaScript conference, JSConf, began in 2009 and has since spawned
                dozens of
                spin-off events around the world.</li>
            <li>One of the most popular JavaScript libraries, jQuery, was created in 2006 by John Resig, and is still
                widely used today.</li>
            <li>The ECMAScript specification, which defines the language features and syntax of JavaScript, is updated
                regularly, with
                the latest version being ECMAScript 2022.</li>
            <li>JavaScript is used not only for web development, but also for server-side programming (with Node.js),
                desktop
                applications (with Electron), and even machine learning (with TensorFlow.js).</li>
            <li>JavaScript has many quirky features, such as type coercion and automatic semicolon insertion, which can
                sometimes trip
                up even experienced developers.</li>
            <li>The JavaScript logo features a blue infinity symbol, which represents the language's ability to be
                endlessly extended
                and adapted to new use cases and technologies.</li>
            <li>The TIOBE Index, which ranks programming languages based on their popularity and usage, consistently
                places JavaScript
                in the top 10 most popular languages.</li>

        <p>JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in just 10 days in May 1995, while he was working at Netscape
            Communications
            Corporation. Originally named Mocha, then renamed to LiveScript and eventually JavaScript, it was designed
            as a
            scripting language for use with the Netscape Navigator browser. It quickly gained popularity and was adopted
            by other
            web browsers. In 1997, the language was standardized as ECMAScript and has since undergone several updates
            and
            revisions. Today, JavaScript is one of the most widely used programming languages, powering the majority of
            interactive
            web pages, web applications, and server-side programming with Node.js.</p>
