        <section id="appointment_app">
            <h2>Appointment App for a Therapist</h2>
            <p>I'm actually making this for my mother. She's still using a traditional calendar to write down her
                appointments even though she is remarkably digitally adept for someone born in WWII.
                I reckon I can only improve things for her by making this app.</p>
            <h3>Main Page</h3>

            <br>

            <p>At this stage the main page of the app has a placeholder for booking consults and buttons to go to client
                overview, consults, invoicing and close, respectively.
                There is a button for consults since I'm considering to separate the booking part out and change the
                main
                screen to just show the booked appointments. It feels like that would be easier to program and maintain.
                Being able to do everything in one page is nice but it can get a bit cluttered. This should be easier to
                understand and less prone to mistakes. Also, there is some placeholder text under the calendar which
                shows some nonsense about how many slots do not have a client. This will probably be changed to show how
                many clients have not been invoiced for the previous month. That seems like it would be more relevant.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/Appointment App Main Page.png" alt="Main page of the appointment app" width="591"
                    height="450">
                <figcaption><em>main page with placeholder consult booking</em></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <br>

            <h3>Client Database</h3>

            <br>

            <p>Clicking on the Clients button will take you to the database. This is based on a JSON file but will
                eventually use a MySQL database.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/Appointment Page Client Overview.png" alt="Client database" width="1196" height="547">
                <figcaption><em>Client database, all people are fictitious</em></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <br>

            <p>The field at the top of the window lets you filter the clients by surname.
                Clicking the middle button at the bottom brings you to a similar window that allows to enter the raw
                data.
                In the window the raw data for first and last name is combined in name. The different address attributes
                are
                also combined. There is a method that selects the zodiac sign based on the birth date that was entered.
                There's a column that shows if a client is still actively getting consultation or is archived.
                The archivebox column will show in which box the documentation for the ex-client can be found.</p>

            <h3>Invoicing</h3>

            <br>

            <p>You can get to this window from the main screen as well. There's some address placeholder here that
                probably
                doesn't make any sense.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="img/Appointment App Invoice Total.png" alt="Invoice window">
                <figcaption><em>Invoicing screen, showing total invoicing value</em></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <br>

            <p>Selecting a client will then filter the displayed invoicing to just that client</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="img/Appointment App Invoice Client.png"
                    alt="Invoice window with invoicing filtered for the selected client">
                <figcaption><em>Invoicing screen, showing invoicing value for the selected client</em></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <br>

            <p>The two buttons at the top right will (eventually) allow further filtering per month and year which
                should
                help with administration and tax returns.</p>
