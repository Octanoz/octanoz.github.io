        <h2>History of Guitars</h2>

        <p>The history of guitars can be traced back to ancient times, with stringed instruments like the oud and the
            lute being
            the predecessors of the modern guitar. The word guitar itself comes from the Spanish word "guitarra", which
            is derived
            from the Arabic word "qitara". The modern six-string guitar that we know today began to take shape in the
            16th century
            in Spain, with many different types and variations being developed over time. In the late 1800s, steel
            strings were
            introduced, which allowed for greater volume and projection. The first electric guitar was invented in the
            1930s and
            paved the way for an entire new era of musical styles and genres. Today, guitars come in a wide range of
            styles and
            types, including acoustic, electric, classical, and many more.</p>
