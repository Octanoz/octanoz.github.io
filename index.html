        <h1>Learning to become a programmer</h1>
        <p>I used to work in Ireland before the corona-crisis. My department at the biggest server manufacturer was made
            redundant during that crisis.
            As that specific job seems to be hard to find back in the Netherlands I started looking for other jobs,
            maybe a study to follow that would allow for a career switch.</p>
        <p>Long story short, I tried my hand at programming, which I always expected to be extremely hard, and found
            that I actually really enjoy learning it and doing it!
            I have focused mostly on C# but also learned some HTML, CSS, MySQL, LINQ and JavaScript along the way.
            I'll stop the boring part now and share some of the things I learned. If you're really interested I'll post
            more in the <span class="nowrap"><a href="about_me.html">About Me</a></span>.</p>
        <p>I'll post some of the web related things here on the main page.</p>

            <h2>HTML Tutorials</h2>
            <p>I have exclusively followed the <span class="nowrap"><a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0EGYTb1cBs&list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6OlAwitnFUubtE93DO-l0vu">HTML
                        tutorials by Dave Gray</a></span> which have been absolutely fantastic.
                I did learn some HTML 20 years ago but I'm sure that hardly had any impact on following along with this.
                I like to code along with tutorials and it's been very easy with Dave's tutorials and they're very easy
                to
                follow.</p>
            <p>Following along with the tutorial, the final product will look something like <a
                    href="Lesson_01/tutorial.html">this</a>.</p>
            <p>The final assignment is making a website for <a href="Little_Taco_Shop/lts.html">The
                    Little Taco Shop</a>. This will also be the final assignment for the CSS tutorials below.</p>

            <p>Here is where things get more interesting with styling we can apply to the standard HTML.
                The most interesting links, the projects, are marked in brown. Most of the other links will not show
                anything interesting if you're not looking at the DevTools. I might decide to remove them later.
                Even the first project will only make sense on a computer since it explores hovering over menu items.
